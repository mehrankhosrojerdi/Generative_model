# Differentiable Learning of Quantum Circuit Born Machine
In the README.md of this repository I'll address to the Quantum Circuit Born Machine or QCBM. I will start with a brief description of th generative model and the key concept behind that. Then, I'll describe different types of allgorithems in this model with a special attention to the Generative Adversarial Network or GAN. Following that I'll address to the QCBM and finally I will describe how the model and algorithem work.
